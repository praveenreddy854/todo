Classify the user query into one of the above actions.\n2. Classify if the user query requires the TODO context or not.\n\nLet's look at some examples:\n\nuser query: Create a TODO to Watch cricket match on Sunday 8:30AM\naction: create\nrequires TODO context: false\nthought process: The user query starts with the word \"Create\" so it is a create action. The TODO context is not required because user is adding a new TODO with the given title.\n\nuser query: Check if I have TODOs to meet Mr. X\naction: list\nrequires TODO context: true\nthought process: The user query contains the word check so it is a list action. The list action requires the all the TODO titles to be passed as an argument so LLM can classify if the titles match the TODO to meet Mr. X so it requires TODO context.\n\nuser query: Delete the TODO with ID 1\naction: delete\nrequires TODO context: false\nthought process: The user query starts with the word \"Delete\" so it is a delete action. The TODO context is not required because user is asking to delete a TODO with give TODO ID.\n\nuser query: Update the TODO with ID 1\naction: update\nrequires TODO context: false\nthought process: The user query starts with the word \"Update\" so it is a update action. The TODO context is not required because user is asking to update a TODO title so we don't need to pass the original title to LLM.\n\nuser query: Unhide the TODOs with IDs 1, 2, 3\naction: update\nrequires TODO context: false\nthought process: The user query starts with the word \"Unhide\" so it is a update action. The TODO context is not required because user is asking to unhide TODOs with give TODO IDs.\n\nuser query: Show the hidden TODOs with IDs 1, 2, 3\naction: update\nrequires TODO context: false\nthought process: The user query starts with the word \"Show the hidden\" so it is a update action. The TODO context is not required because user is asking to show the hidden TODOs with give TODO IDs.\n";
